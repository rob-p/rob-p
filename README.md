### Hi 👋 — I'm Rob 

  I lead the [COMBINE-lab](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab) at the University of Maryland, where I am an associate professor of Computer Science and a member of UMIACS and the Center for Bioinformatic and Computational Biology.  We (the COMBINE-lab) work mostly on algorithms and data structures for efficient processing, indexing, querying and inferece in high-throughput sequencing data.  

#### Some Info

🌱 I’m currently learning Rust (and think it is a strong contender to replace / augment C++ in compute-intensive bioinformatics applications)!

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects related to processing, indexing, querying and inferece in high-throughput sequencing data (after all, it's what we do!).
